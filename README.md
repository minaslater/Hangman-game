# Doctor Who Hangman!

OH NO! The TARDIS's translation circuit got fried and everything must be translated manually, one letter at a time. Help The Doctor communicate until he can get the circuit back up and running.

-----
In this hangman-style game, some terms in the Doctor Who universe are appearing only in Circular Gallifreyan. In order to save the World and the galaxies beyond, we must translate the words into English before we run out of guesses.

Good luck!
